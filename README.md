# Zomato Data Analysis
## Summary: 
This project is a part of Coding Ninjas Course: Data Science & Machine Learning. In this project, I have used my learning to solve the questions which were asked with the help of python packages such as numpy, matplot, pandas and APIs of Zomato. The dataset I have used was provided by Coding Ninjas.

### Software Requirements:
1. Anaconda
2. Web browser such as Google Chrome
### Downloads:
1. [Anacoda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)
